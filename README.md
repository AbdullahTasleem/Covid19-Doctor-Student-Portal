Problem/Solution Description: 

## Problem:

1.	Doctors and healthcare workers are facing massive challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic. They are leading the fight against Corona virus and are working more than 15 hours a day. These 15 hours aren’t just normal working hours, but continuous hours filled with stress and complete mental and physical drain. If we want to win this fight then we need to support the doctors as much as possible and help them in dealing with the shortage of staff, look after their mental wellbeing and take care of the increasing number of diagnosed people. 
2.	Medical university students are quarantined at home unsure about their future as they are not able to continue their education and complete their field work credits. They know that the world is likely to experience this disease outbreak to linger around for months or years to come and are ready to provide support. However, they are unclear about the instructions on how to get prepared and where to get started.

## Solution:

IBM D&S Market Place platform will serve as a one-stop-shop that will allow health authorities, hospitals, doctors, medical universities and medical students to come together and support the fight against the Covid-19 Pandemic. 

#### 1.	It will deal with the shortage of doctors:

IBM D&S Market Place will allow health authorities to post volunteering requests for various hospitals around the region so that the medical students can apply to volunteer in one or more places. 

The platform will give the opportunity to Doctors and Medical students to work together and provide support to the patients. It will reduce stress on the doctors, provide on-site training to the medical students and offer field work credits for their university and also allow to better serve the patients.

Here are the steps of how all the entities will interact with the platform:

1.	Health authorities will post volunteering requests with the name of the hospitals, location, number of volunteers needed and a job description.
2.	Medical Students can apply to the requests of their choice 
3.	Medical institutions will approve the students’ requests for volunteering
4.	Medical students will go through the training required before starting their volunteering jobs
5.	Hospitals will receive a list of all students who have been accepted by the medical institutions

#### 2.	Training guide for the volunteers

In order to make sure students are prepared for such situations, we need to make sure we enable them with courses on how to deal with pandemics during COVID-19 and what are the things they need to know before/after signing up for their volunteering placement or internship.  

Healthcare professionals want the very best for their patients and doctors across the country are doing everything they can to ensure those infected with the virus get the best medical treatment possible, however they in need for extra support so the platform will help them find new resources to help them out. 

#### 3.   Doctors wellbeing

One of the unique features in this site is that It will include specific material for Doctors to meditation and mindfulness videos. This will allow them to take quick 2-5 mins break from their work and help them relax for some time. Along with this they will also be able to ask for help from volunteers and medical students in the hospital (especially in the COVID-19 pandemic). 

#### 4. Chatbot support

The platform will provide a chatbot for:

1.	Quick site navigation
2.	Answering any type of FAQs
3.	Providing quick access to a catalog of emergency contacts
4.	Continuously analyze the doctors and volunteers conversation to monitor their stress and see if it’s feasible to guide them to just mindfulness materials or send them for psychiatric help.
